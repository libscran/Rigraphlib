# Overview

`r self` builds the **igraph** static library for use in R/Bioconductor packages.
This is primarily intended for R packages that wrap other C/C++ libraries that depend on the **igraph** C library
and cannot easily be modified to use the usual `r CRANpkg("igraph")` R package.
By vendoring in the source code, we also reduce our susceptibility to out-of-release-schedule changes in results due to `r CRANpkg("igraph")` updates.
This also allows developers to access functionality that might yet not be available from the R bindings.

# Quick start

Downstream package developers can use `r self` by adding:

```
LinkingTo: Rlibigraph
```

to their package `DESCRIPTION`, and setting:

```bash
RIGRAPH_LIBS=$(shell "${R_HOME}/bin${R_ARCH_BIN}/Rscript" -e 'Rlibigraph::pkgconfig()'")
PKG_LIBS=$(RIGRAPH_LIBS)
```

in their `src/Makevars`.

# Session information {-}

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

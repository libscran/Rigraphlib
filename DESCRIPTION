Title: igraph library as an R package
License: GPL-3

Description:
    Vendors the igraph source code and builds it into a static library.
    Other Bioconductor packages can link to libigraph.a in their own C/C++ code.
    This is particularly useful for packages wrapping C/C++ libraries that depend on the igraph C library
    and cannot be easily adapted to use the canonical R bindings to igraph.

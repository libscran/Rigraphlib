Description:
    Vendors the igraph C source code and builds it into a static library.
    Other Bioconductor packages can link to libigraph.a in their own C/C++ code.
    This is intended for packages wrapping C/C++ libraries that depend on the igraph C library and cannot be easily adapted to use the igraph R package.
